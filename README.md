# Dive  
Dive is a full-stack sushi encyclopedia app that serves as a comprehensive resource for sushi enthusiasts, offering detailed information about various types of sushi fish commonly used in dishes. It educates users about the characteristics, flavor profiles, origins, and cultural significance of different fish varieties. Additionally, the app promotes environmental awareness by providing information on sustainable fishing practices and seafood certifications. Overall, Dive aims to enhance users' sushi dining experiences by empowering them to make informed choices and deepen their appreciation for sushi cuisine.  

This solo project took approximately 50 working hours and aims to showcase mastery of React fundamentals, asynchronous Javascript, type checking with prop-types, and e2e testing with Cypress. In addition to the UI, an API was built to serve data to the user.
